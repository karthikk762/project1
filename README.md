'''The code you provided is a complete implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

The ConstBoard() function is defined to display the current state of the game board.

def ConstBoard(board):
  print("Current State Board: \n\n")
  for i in range(0,9):
    if ((i>0) and (i%3==0)):
      print('\n')
    if(board[i]==0):
      print("_",end=' ')
    if(board[i]==-1):
      print("X",end=' ')
    if(board[i]==1):
      print("O",end=' ')
  print("\n")
  
It takes the board as an argument.
It iterates over the range from 0 to 8 (representing the positions on the board).
If i is greater than 0 and divisible by 3, it prints a newline character to start a new row.
Depending on the value of board[i], it prints an underscore (_) for an empty position, X for -1, or O for 1.
After printing the entire board, it prints a newline character.

The User1Turn() function is defined to handle the user's (player X) turn.

  
def User1Turn(board):
  pos=int(input("Enter X 's position from[1 to 9]:"))
  if(board[pos-1]!=0):
    print("Wrong Move")
    exit(0)
  board[pos-1]=-1
  
It takes the board as an argument.
It prompts the user to enter the position (from 1 to 9) where they want to place an X.
If the chosen position is already occupied, it prints an error message and exits the program.
If the position is valid and unoccupied, it updates the board with -1 at the chosen position.

The User2Turn() function is defined to handle the second user's (player O) turn.

def User2Turn(board):
  pos=int(input("Enter O 's position from[1 to 9]:"))
  if(board[pos-1]!=0):
    print("Wrong Move")
    exit(0)
  board[pos-1]=1


It takes the board as an argument.
It prompts the user to enter the position (from 1 to 9) where they want to place an O.
If the chosen position is already occupied, it prints an error message and exits the program.
If the position is valid and unoccupied, it updates the board with 1 at the chosen position.

The minmax() function implements the minimax algorithm for the computer's turn.

def minmax(board,player):
  x=analyzeboard(board)
  if(x!=0):
    return(x*player)
  pos=-1
  value=-2
  for i in range(0,9):
    if(board[i]==0):
      board[i]=player
      score=-minmax(board,player*-1)
      board[i]=0
      if(score>value):
        value=score
        pos=i
  if(pos==-1):
    return 0
  return value

  
It takes the board and the current player (1 or -1) as arguments.
It first checks if the game has ended by calling the analyzeboard() function.
If the game has ended, it returns the score multiplied by the player.
Otherwise, it iterates over the positions on the board and checks for valid moves.
For each valid move, it recursively calls itself with the opponent's player value and updates the score.
The function keeps track of the best score and the corresponding position.
Finally, it returns the maximum value found.

The CompTurn() function is defined to handle the computer's turn.

def CompTurn(board):
  pos=-1
  value=-2
  for i in range(0,9):
    if(board[i]==0):
      board[i]=1
      score=-minmax(board,-1)
      board[i]=0
      if(score>value):
        value=score
        pos=i
  board[pos]=1

  
It takes the board as an argument.
It initializes variables for the best position and value.
It iterates over the positions on the board and checks for valid moves.
For each valid move, it uses the minmax() function to determine the score.
The function keeps track of the best score and the corresponding position.
Finally, it updates the board with 1 at the chosen position.

The analyzeboard() function is defined to check if the game has been won or ended in a draw.

def analyzeboard(board):
  cb=[[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8],[0,3,6],[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[0,4,8],[2,4,6]]
  for i in range(0,8):
    if (board[cb[i][0]]!=0 and board[cb[i][0]]==board[cb[i][1]] and board[cb[i][0]]==board[cb[i][2]]):
      return board[cb[i][0]];
  return 0

  
It takes the board as an argument.
It defines a list of winning combinations, cb, representing rows, columns, and diagonals.
It checks each combination to see if the same player occupies all three positions.
If a winning combination is found, it returns the player's value.
If no winning combination is found, it returns 0.

The main() function is defined as the entry point of the program.

def main():
  choice=int(input("Enter 1  for single player,2 for Multiplayer: "))
  board=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  if choice==1:
    print("Computer: 0 vs You: X")
    player=int(input("Do you want play 1(st) or 2(nd) :"))
    for i in range(0,9):
      if analyzeboard(board)!=0:
        break
      if (i+player)%2==0:
        CompTurn(board)
      else:
        ConstBoard(board)
        User1Turn(board)
  elif choice==2:
    for i in range(0,9):
      if(analyzeboard(board)!=0):
        break
      if(i%2)==0:
        ConstBoard(board)
        User1Turn(board)
      else:
        ConstBoard(board)
        User2Turn(board)
  else:
    print("Invalid")
    exit()
  x=analyzeboard(board)
  if (x==0):
    ConstBoard(board)
    print("Draw")
  if (x==-1):
    ConstBoard(board)
    print("Player X Win")
  if (x==1):
    ConstBoard(board)
    print("Player 0 Wins")
main()


It prompts the user to enter their choice: 1 for single player or 2 for multiplayer.
It initializes the board as a list representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
If the user chooses single player (choice 1), the game starts with the computer playing as player O and the user playing as player X.
The player is asked whether they want to play first or second.
A loop runs for a maximum of 9 times, representing the maximum number of moves in Tic-Tac-Toe.
Inside the loop, the analyzeboard() function is called to check if the game has ended.
If the game has ended, the loop is terminated.
If it's the computer's turn (determined by (i+player)%2==0), the CompTurn() function is called to make the computer's move.
If it's the user's turn, the current state of the board is displayed using ConstBoard() and the User1Turn() function is called to get the user's move.
If the user chooses multiplayer (choice 2), the game starts with two players taking turns.
After the game ends, the analyzeboard() function is called again to determine the result.
The result is printed on the screen along with the current state of the board using ConstBoard().'''
